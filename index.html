          <h4>Jonathan</h4><img src="img/profile.jpeg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="10" width=125w>
          <p>Knows just enough Swift to know what it's capable of, but not capable of making a killer app on his own. A growing family and military career keeps him busy, and shows him daily the importance of relationships and communication. Jonathan loves learning about new tech and working on ways to apply it in novel ways to improve quality of life.</p>

          <h4>Thomas P.</h4>
          <p>Swift Tinkerer par excellance. Thomas took a path less traveled in school by focusing on Swift development, and it's made a big difference for us. His initial work opened our eyes to what was possible in the Swift ecosystem, especially when it came to the visualizations of data in the Apple contact framework.</p>
